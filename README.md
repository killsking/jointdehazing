This preoject is for our paper SINGLE IMAGE HAZE REMOVAL VIA JOINT ESTIMATION OF DETAIL AND TRANSMISSION
The test system is win10 and caffe. I provide the pixel voting in python file. For matlab, we did not provide the function.
I used the code provided by https://github.com/zlinker/DehazeNet.
More details can be found in our paper Joint learning of image detail and transmission map for single image dehazing (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00371-018-1612-9)
